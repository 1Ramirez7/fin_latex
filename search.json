    "text": "The Arithmetic Mean\nAnalysts and portfolio managers often want one number that describes a representative possible outcome of an investment decision. The arithmetic mean is one of the most frequently used measures of central tendency.\nArithmetic Mean. The arithmetic mean is the sum of the values of the observations in a dataset divided by the number of observations.\n\nThe Sample Mean\nThe sample mean is the arithmetic mean, or arithmetic average, computed for a sample.\nSample Mean Formula. The sample mean or average, \\(\\bar{X}\\) (read “X-bar”), is the arithmetic mean value of a sample:\n\\[\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n},\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of observations in the sample.\nA property and potential drawback of the arithmetic mean is its sensitivity to extreme values, or outliers. Because all observations are used to compute the mean and are given equal weight (i.e., importance), the arithmetic mean can be pulled sharply upward or downward by extremely large or small observations, respectively. The most common approach in this situation is to report the median, or middle value, in place of or in addition to the mean.\n\nThe Median\nA second important measure of central tendency is the median.\nDefinition of Median. The median is the value of the middle item of a dataset that has been sorted in ascending or descending order. In an odd-numbered sample of \\(n\\) observations, the median is the value of the observation that occupies the \\((n + 1)/2\\) position. In an even-numbered sample, we define the median as the mean of the values of the observations occupying the \\(n/2\\) and \\((n + 2)/2\\) positions (the two middle observations).\nWhether we use the calculation for an even- or odd-numbered sample, an equal number of observations lie above and below the median. A distribution has only one median. A potential advantage of the median is that, unlike the mean, outliers do not affect it.\nThe median, however, does not use all the information about the size of the observations; it focuses only on the relative position of the ranked observations. Calculating the median may also be more complex. Mathematicians express this disadvantage by saying that the median is less mathematically tractable than the mean.\n\nThe Mode\nA third important measure of central tendency is the mode.\nDefinition of Mode. The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. A dataset can have more than one mode, or even no mode. When a dataset has a single value that is observed most frequently, its distribution is said to be unimodal. If a dataset has two most frequently occurring values, then it has two modes and its distribution is referred to as bimodal. When all the values in a dataset are different, the distribution has no mode because no value occurs more frequently than any other value.\nStock return data and other data from continuous distributions may not have a modal outcome. Exhibit 2 presents the frequency distribution of the daily returns for the EAA Equity Index over the past five years.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, although an extreme value or outlier in a financial dataset may represent a rare value in the population, it may also reflect an error in recording the value of an observation or an observation generated from a different population. After having checked and eliminated errors, we can address what to do with extreme values in the sample.\nWhen dealing with a sample that has extreme values, there may be a possibility of transforming the variable (e.g., a log transformation) or of selecting another variable that achieves the same purpose. If, however, alternative model specifications or variable transformations are not possible, then three options exist for dealing with extreme values:\nOption 1 Do nothing; use the data without any adjustment.\nOption 2 Delete all the outliers.\nOption 3 Replace the outliers with another value.\nThe first option is appropriate if the values are legitimate, correct observations, and it is important to reflect the whole of the sample distribution. Because outliers may contain meaningful information, excluding or altering these values may reduce valuable information. Further, because identifying a data point as extreme leaves it up to the judgment of the analyst, leaving in all observations eliminates the need to judge a value as extreme.\nThe second option excludes the extreme observations. One measure of central tendency in this case is the trimmed mean, which is computing an arithmetic mean after excluding a stated small percentage of the lowest and highest values. For example, a 5 percent trimmed mean discards the lowest 2.5 percent and the highest 2.5 percent of values and computes the mean of the remaining 95 percent of values. A trimmed mean is used in sports competitions when judges’ lowest and highest scores are discarded in computing a contestant’s score.\nThe third option involves substituting values for the extreme values. A measure of central tendency in this case is the winsorized mean. It is calculated after assigning one specified low value to a stated percentage of the lowest values in the dataset and one specified high value to a stated percentage of the highest values in the dataset. For example, a 95 percent winsorized mean sets the bottom 2.5 percent of values in the dataset equal to the value at or below which 2.5 percent of all the values lie (as will be seen shortly, this is called the “2.5th percentile” value) and the top 2.5 percent of values in the dataset equal to the value at or below which 97.5 percent of all the values lie (the “97.5th percentile” value).\nOften comparing the statistical measures of datasets with outliers included and with outliers excluded can reveal important insights about the dataset. Such comparison can be particularly helpful when investors analyze the behavior of asset returns and rate, price, spread and volume changes.\nIn Example 1, we show the differences among these options for handling outliers using daily returns for the fictitious Euro-Asia-Africa (EAA) Equity Index in Exhibit 2.\n\n\n\n\nHaving discussed measures of central tendency, we now examine an approach to describing the location of data that involves identifying values at or below which specified proportions of the data lie. For example, establishing that 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent of the annual returns on a portfolio provides concise information about the distribution of portfolio returns. Statisticians use the word quantile as the most general term for a value at or below which a stated fraction of the data lies. In the following section, we describe the most commonly used quantiles—quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles—and their application in investments.\nQuartiles, Quintiles, Deciles, and Percentiles\nWe know that the median divides a distribution of data in half. We can define other dividing lines that split the distribution into smaller sizes. Quartiles divide the distribution into quarters, quintiles into fifths, deciles into tenths, and percentiles into hundredths. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile, or \\(IQR = Q_3 - Q_1\\).\nExample 2 illustrates the calculation of various quantiles for the daily return on the EAA Equity Index.",

It is the simplest of all the measures of dispersion.\nIn this lesson, we examine the most common measures of dispersion: range, mean absolute deviation, variance, and standard deviation.

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset: \\[\n\\text{Range = Maximum value − Minimum value} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nAn alternative way to report the range is to specify both the maximum and minimum values. This alternative definition provides more information as the range is reported as “from Maximum Value to Minimum Value.”\nOne advantage of the range is ease of computation. A disadvantage is that the range uses only two pieces of information from the distribution. It cannot tell us how the data are distributed (i.e., the shape of the distribution). Because the range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, it is also sensitive to extremely large or small observations (“outliers”) that may not be representative of the distribution.",

The MAD for a sample is:\n\\[\n\\text{MAD} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |X_i - \\bar{X}|}{n}\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, \\(n\\) is the number of observations in the sample, and the \\(|\\,|\\) indicate the absolute value of what is contained within these bars.\n     The MAD uses all of the observations in the sample and is thus superior to the range as a measure of dispersion.

    "section": "Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation",
    "text": "Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation\nA second approach to the problem of positive and negative deviations canceling out is to square them. Variance and standard deviation, which are based on squared deviations, are the two most widely used measures of dispersion. Variance is defined as the average of the squared deviations around the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nSample Variance\nIn investments, we often do not know the mean of a population of interest, so we estimate it using the mean from a sample drawn from the population. The corresponding measure of dispersion is the sample variance or standard deviation.\nSample Variance Formula. The sample variance, \\(s^2\\), is:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}{n - 1},\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean and \\(n\\) is the number of observations in the sample.\nThe variance calculation takes care of the problem of negative deviations from the mean canceling out positive deviations by squaring those deviations.\nFor the sample variance, by dividing by the sample size minus 1 (or \\(n - 1\\)) rather than \\(n\\), we improve the statistical properties of the sample variance. The quantity \\(n - 1\\) is also known as the number of degrees of freedom in estimating the population variance. To estimate the population variance with \\(s^2\\), we must first calculate the sample mean, which itself is an estimated parameter. Therefore, once we have computed the sample mean, there are only \\(n - 1\\) independent pieces of information from the sample; that is, if you know the sample mean and \\(n - 1\\) of the observations, you could calculate the missing sample observation.\nSample Standard Deviation\nVariance is measured in squared units associated with the mean, and we need a way to return to those original units. Standard deviation, the square root of the variance, solves this problem and is more easily interpreted than the variance.\nA useful property of the sample standard deviation is that, unlike sample variance, it is expressed in the same unit as the data itself. If the dataset is percentage of daily returns for an index, then both the average and the standard deviation of the dataset is in percentage terms, while the variance is in squared percentage of daily returns.\nSample Standard Deviation Formula. The sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), is:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}{n - 1}},\n\\tag{5}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean and \\(n\\) is the number of observations in the sample.\nBecause the standard deviation is a measure of dispersion about the arithmetic mean, we usually present the arithmetic mean and standard deviation together when summarizing data. When we are dealing with data that represent a time series of percentage changes, presenting the geometric mean (i.e., representing the compound rate of growth) is also very helpful.",

    "text": "Downside Deviation and Coefficient of Variation\nAn asset’s variance or standard deviation of returns is often interpreted as a measure of the asset’s risk. Variance and standard deviation of returns take account of returns above and below the mean, or upside and downside risks, respectively. However, investors are typically concerned only with downside risk—for example, returns below the mean or below some specified minimum target return. As a result, analysts have developed measures of downside risk.\n\nDownside Deviation\nIn practice, we may be concerned with values of return (or another variable) below some level other than the mean. For example, if our return objective is 6.0 percent annually (our minimum acceptable return), then we may be concerned particularly with returns below 6.0 percent a year. The target downside deviation, also referred to as the target semideviation, is a measure of dispersion of the observations (here, returns) below a target, for example 6.0 percent. To calculate a sample target semideviation, we first specify the target. After identifying observations below the target, we find the sum of those squared negative deviations from the target, divide that sum by the total number of observations in the sample minus 1, and finally, take the square root.\nSample Target Semideviation Formula. The target semideviation, \\(S_{Target}\\), is:\n\\[\nS_{\\text{target}}\n=\n\\sqrt{\n\\sum\\nolimits_{\\text{for all} X_i \\le B}^{n}\n\\frac{(X_i - B)^2}{n - 1}\n} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is the target and \\(n\\) is the total number of sample observations.\nWe illustrate this in Example 3.\n\nCoefficient of Variation\nCoefficient of Variation Formula.

The first step in considering how two variables vary together, however, is constructing their covariance.\n\nDefinition of Sample Covariance.\nThe sample covariance (\\(s_{XY}\\)) is a measure of how two variables in a sample move together:\n\\[\ns_{XY} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n - 1}.\n\\tag{10}\n\\]\nEquation 10 indicates that the sample covariance is the average value of the product of the deviations of observations on two random variables (\\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\)) from their sample means. If the random variables are returns, the units would be returns squared. Also, note the use of \\(n - 1\\) in the denominator, which ensures that the sample covariance is an unbiased estimate of population covariance.\nStated simply, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. If the random variables vary in the same direction, for example, \\(X\\) tends to be above its mean when \\(Y\\) is above its mean, and \\(X\\) tends to be below its mean when \\(Y\\) is below its mean, then their covariance is positive. If the variables vary in the opposite direction relative to their respective means, then their covariance is negative.\nThe size of the covariance measure alone is difficult to interpret as it involves squared units of measure and so depends on the magnitude of the variables. This brings us to the normalized version of covariance, which is the correlation coefficient.\n\nDefinition of Sample Correlation Coefficient.\nThe sample correlation coefficient is a standardized measure of how two variables in a sample move together. The sample correlation coefficient (\\(r_{XY}\\)) is the ratio of the sample covariance to the product of the two variables’ standard deviations:\n\\[\nr_{XY} = \\frac{s_{XY}}{s_X s_Y}.\n\\tag{11}\n\\]\nImportantly, the correlation coefficient expresses the strength of the linear relationship between the two random variables.",

    "text": "In general, the relationship between a current or present value (\\(PV\\)) and future value (\\(FV\\)) of a cash flow, where \\(r\\) is the stated discount rate per period and \\(t\\) is the number of compounding periods, is as follows:\n\\[FV_t = PV(1+r)^t \\tag{1}\\]\n\nIf the number of compounding periods t is very large, that is, \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we compound the initial cash flow on a continuous basis as follows:\n\\[FV_t = PVe^{r t} \\tag{2}\\]\n\nConversely, present values can be expressed in future value terms, which requires recasting Equation 1 as follows:\n\\[FV_t = PV(1+r)^t\\] \\[PV = FV_t \\left[ \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} \\right]\\] \\[PV = FV_t (1+r)^{-t} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe continuous time equivalent expression of Equation 3 is as follows:\n\\[PV_t = FV e^{-rt} \\tag{4}\\]\n\nThe present value \\((PV)\\) calculation for a discount bond with principal \\((FV)\\) paid at time \\(t\\) with a market discount rate of \\(r\\) per period is:\n\\[PV(Discount Bond) = FV_t / (1+r)^t \\tag{5}\\]\nThe investor’s sole source of return is the difference between the price paid (PV) and full principal (FV) received at maturity. This type of bond is often referred to as a zero-coupon bond given the lack of intermediate interest cash flows, which for bonds are generally referred to as coupons.\n\nPricing a coupon bond extends the single cash flow calculation for a discount bond to a general formula for calculating a bond’s price \\((PV)\\) given the market discount rate on a coupon date, as follows:\nPV(Coupon Bond) \\[= \\frac{PMT_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{PMT_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\dots + \\frac{PMT_N + FV_N}{(1+r)^N} \\tag{6}\\]\n\nA perpetual bond is a less common type of coupon bond with no stated maturity date. Most perpetual bonds are issued by companies to obtain equity-like financing and often include redemption features. As \\(N \\to \\infty\\) in Equation 6, we can simplify this to solve for the present value of a perpetuity (or perpetual fixed periodic cash flow without early redemption), where \\(r &gt; 0\\), as follows:\n\\[PV_{\\text{Perpetual Bond}} = \\frac{PMT}{r} \\tag{7}\\]\n\nWe may calculate the periodic annuity cash flow \\((A)\\), which occurs at the end of each respective period, as follows:\n\\[A = \\frac{r(PV)}{1-(1+r)^{-t}} \\tag{8}\\]\nwhere:\n\\(A\\) = periodic cash flow,\n\\(r\\) = market interest rate per period,\n\\(PV\\) = present value or principal amount of loan or bond, and\n\\(t\\) = number of payment periods.\n\nThe price of a preferred or common share expected to pay a constant periodic dividend is an infinite series that simplifies to the formula for the present value of a perpetuity shown and is similar to the valuation of a perpetual bond that we encountered earlier. Specifically, the valuation in Equation 7:\n\\[\nPV_t = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_t}{(1+r)^i} \\text{, and} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[PV_t = \\frac{D_t}{r} \\tag{10}\\]\n\nIf dividends grow at a rate of g per period and are paid at the end of each period, the next dividend (at time \\(t+1\\)) may be shown as follows:\n\\[D_{t+1} = D_t(1+g) \\tag{11}\\]\nor generally in \\(i\\) periods as:\n\\[D_{t+i} = D_t(1+g)^i \\tag{12}\\]\nIf dividend cash flows continue to grow at \\(g\\) indefinitely, then we may rewrite Equation 10 as follows:\n\\[PV_t = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_t(1+g)^i}{(1+r)^i} \\tag{13}\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[PV_t = \\frac{D_t(1+g)}{r-g} = \\frac{D_{t+1}}{r-g} \\tag{14}\\]\nwhere \\(r-g &gt; 0\\).\n\nThe example in Exhibit 6 shows a company with an initial higher short-term dividend growth of \\(g_s\\) for the first three years, followed by lower long-term growth \\((g_l \\text{, where }g_s &gt; g_l)\\) indefinitely thereafter. If we generalize the initial growth phase to \\(n\\) periods followed by indefinite slower growth at \\(g_l\\), we obtain a modified version of Equation 14 as follows:\n\\[PV_t = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{D_t(1+g_s)^i}{(1+r)^i} + \\sum\\nolimits_{j=n+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_{t+n}(1+g_l)^j}{(1+r)^j} \\tag{15}\\]\nNote that the second expression in Equation 15 involves constant growth starting in \\(n\\) periods, for which we can substitute the geometric series simplification:\n\\[PV_t = \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{D_t(1+g_s)^i}{(1+r)^i} + \\frac{E(S_{t+n})}{(1+r)^n} \\tag{16}\\]\nwhere the stock value of the stock in n periods \\((E(S_{t+n})\\) is referred to as the terminal value) and is equal to the following:\n\\[E(S_{t+n}) = \\frac{D_{t+n+1}}{r-g_l} \\tag{17}\\]\n\nWe may rearrange Equation 5 from earlier to solve for the implied periodic return earned over the life of the instrument (\\(t\\) periods):\n\\[r = \\sqrt[t]{\\frac{FV_t}{PV}} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{FV_t}{PV} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} - 1 \\tag{18}\\]\n\nThe \\(YTM\\) assumes an investor expects to receive all promised cash flows through maturity and reinvest any cash received at the same \\(YTM\\). For coupon bonds, this involves periodic interest payments only, while for level payment instruments such as mortgages, the calculation assumes both interest and amortized principal may be invested at the same rate. Like other internal rates of return, the \\(YTM\\) cannot be solved using an equation, but it may be calculated using iteration with a spreadsheet or calculator, a process that solves for \\(r\\) in Equation 19, as follows:\n\\[PV(Coupon\\ Bond)\n= \\frac{PMT_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{PMT_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\dots + \\frac{PMT_N + FV_N}{(1+r)^N} \\tag{19}\\]\nwhere \\(FV\\) equals a bond’s principal and \\(N\\) is the number of periods to maturity.\nThe Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets \\(YIELD\\) function can be used to calculate \\(YTM\\) for fixed-income instruments with periodic interest and full principal payment at maturity:\n= YIELD (settlement, maturity, rate, pr, redemption, frequency, [basis])\nwhere:\nsettlement = settlement date entered using the DATE function;\nmaturity = maturity date entered using the DATE function;\nrate = semi-annual (or periodic) coupon;\npr = price per 100 face value;\nredemption = future value at maturity;\nfrequency = number of coupons per year; and\n[basis] = day count convention, 1 through 5 for US bonds (30/360 day count).\n\nEquity Instruments, Implied Return, and Implied Growth\nAs noted in the discussion of calculating the present value of an equity investment, the price of a share of stock reflects not only the required return but also the growth of cash flows. If we begin with an assumption of constant growth of dividends from Equation 14, we can rearrange the formula as follows:\n\\[r - g = \\frac{D_t(1+g)}{PV_t} = \\frac{D_{t+1}}{PV_t} \\tag{20}\\]\nThe left-hand side of Equation 20 simply reflects the difference between the required return and the constant growth rate, and the right-hand side is the dividend yield of the stock based on expected dividends over the next period. Thus, the implied return on a stock given its expected dividend yield and growth is given by Equation 21, as follows:\n\\[r = \\frac{D_t(1+g)}{PV_t} + g = \\frac{D_{t+1}}{PV_t} + g \\tag{21}\\]\nSimply put, if we assume that a stock’s dividend grows at a constant rate in perpetuity, the stock’s implied return is equal to its expected dividend yield plus the constant growth rate.\nAlternatively, we may be interested in solving for a stock’s implied growth rate, and this relation is given by Equation 22:\n\\[g = \\frac{r * PV_t - D_t}{PV_t + D_t} = r - \\frac{D_{t+1}}{PV_t} \\tag{22}\\]\n\nImplied Return and Growth\nPrice-to-earnings ratios not only are used for individual stocks but also are a val- uation metric for stock indexes, such S&P 500, FTSE 100, or Nikkei 225. Here, the stock index value is divided by a weighted sum of the index constituents’ earnings per share. This will be explored in depth later in the curriculum, but we can relate the price-to-earnings ratio to our earlier discussion of relating a stock’s price (\\(PV\\)) to expected future cash flows to make some useful observations. First, recall Equation 14:\n\\[PV_t = \\frac{D_t(1+g)}{r-g}\\]\nWe can divide both sides by \\(E_t\\), earnings per share for period \\(t\\), to obtain:\n\\[\\frac{PV_t}{E_t} = \\frac{ \\frac{D_t}{E_t} \\times (1+g) }{ r - g } \\tag{23}\\]\nThe left-hand side of Equation 23 is the price-to-earnings ratio, whereas the first term in the numerator on the right is the proportion of earnings distributed to shareholders as dividends known as the dividend payout ratio.\n\nIn practice, the forward price-to-earnings ratio or ratio of its share price to an estimate of its next period (t+1) earnings per share is commonly used. With it, we can simplify the previous equation as follows:\n\\[\\frac{PV_t}{E_{t+1}} = \\frac{ \\frac{D_{t+1}}{E_{t+1}} }{ r - g }\\tag{24}\\]\nFrom Equation 24, we can see that forward price-to-earnings ratio is positively related to higher expected dividend payout ratio and higher expected growth but is negatively related to the required return.\n\nUnder the cash flow additivity principle, a risk-neutral investor would be indifferent between strategies 1 and 2 under the following condition:\n\\[FV_2 = PV_0 \\times (1+r_2)^2 = PV_0 \\times (1+r_1)(1+F_{1,1}) \\tag{25}\\]\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "3 RATES OF RETURN\n\nA holding period return, \\(R\\), is the return earned from holding an asset for a single specified period of time. The period may be one day, one week, one month, five years, or any specified period. If the asset (e.g., bond, stock) is purchased today, time \\((t = 0)\\), at a price of 100 and sold later, say at time \\((t = 1)\\), at a price of 105 with no dividends or other income, then the holding period return is 5 percent \\([(105 - 100)/100]\\). If the asset also pays income of two units at time \\((t = 1)\\), then the total return is 7 percent. This return can be generalized and shown as a mathematical expression in which \\(P\\) is the price and \\(I\\) is the income, as follows:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{(P_1 - P_0) + I_1}{P_0} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhere the subscript indicates the time of the price or income; \\((t = 0)\\) is the beginning of the period; and \\((t = 1)\\) is the end of the period. The following two observations are important.\n\nWe computed a capital gain of 5 percent and an income yield of 2 percent in this example. For ease of illustration, we assumed that the income is paid at time \\(t = 1\\). If the income was received before \\(t = 1\\), our holding period return may have been higher if we had reinvested the income for the remainder of the period.\nReturn can be expressed in decimals \\((0.07)\\), fractions \\((7/100)\\), or as a percent \\((7\\) percent\\()\\). They are all equivalent.\n\nA holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For example, an analyst may need to compute a three-year holding period return from three annual returns. In that case, the three-year holding period return is computed by compounding the three annual returns:\n\\[\nR = [(1 + R_1) \\times (1 + R_2) \\times (1 + R_3)] - 1,\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), and \\(R_3\\) are the three annual returns.\n\nArithmetic or Mean Return\nMost holding period returns are reported as daily, monthly, or annual returns. When assets have returns for multiple holding periods, it is necessary to normalize returns to a common period for ease of comparison and understanding. There are different methods for aggregating returns across several holding periods. The remainder of this section presents various ways of computing average returns and discusses their applicability.\nThe simplest way to compute a summary measure for returns across multiple periods is to take a simple arithmetic average of the holding period returns. Thus, three annual returns of −50 percent, 35 percent, and 27 percent will give us an average of 4 percent per year = \\((\\frac{-50\\% + 35\\% + 27\\%}{3})\\). The arithmetic average return is easy to compute and has known statistical properties.\nIn general, the arithmetic or mean return is denoted by \\(\\bar{R}_i\\) and given by the following equation for asset \\(i\\text{,}\\) where \\(R_{it}\\) is the return in period \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) is the total number of periods:\n\\[\n\\bar{R}_i = \\frac{R_{i1} + R_{i2} + \\cdots + R_{i,T-1} + R_{iT}}{T}\n= \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} R_{it}\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nGeometric Mean Return\nThe arithmetic mean return assumes that the amount invested at the beginning of each period is the same. In an investment portfolio, however, even if there are no cash flows into or out of the portfolio the base amount changes each year. The previous year’s earnings must be added to the beginning value of the subsequent year’s investment, these earnings will be “compounded” by the returns earned in that subsequent year. We can use the geometric mean return to account for the compounding of returns.\nA geometric mean return provides a more accurate representation of the growth in portfolio value over a given time period than the arithmetic mean return. In general, the geometric mean return is denoted by \\(\\bar{R}_{Gi}\\) and given by the following equation for asset \\(i\\):\n\\[\n\\bar{R}_{Gi}\n= \\sqrt[T]{(1 + R_{i1}) \\times (1 + R_{i2}) \\times \\cdots \\times (1 + R_{i,T-1}) \\times (1 + R_{iT})} - 1\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt[T]{\\prod\\nolimits_{t=1}^{T} (1 + R_t)} - 1\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_{it}\\) is the return in period \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) is the total number of periods.\nIn the example in the previous section, we calculated the arithmetic mean to be 4.00 percent. Using Equation 3, we can calculate the geometric mean return from the same three annual returns:\n\\[\n\\bar{R}_{Gi}\n= \\sqrt[3]{(1 - 0.50) \\times (1 + 0.35) \\times (1 + 0.27)} - 1\n= -0.0500.\n\\]\n\nThe Harmonic Mean\nThe harmonic mean, \\(\\bar{X}_H\\), is another measure of central tendency. The harmonic mean is appropriate in cases in which the variable is a rate or a ratio. The terminology “harmonic” arises from its use of a type of series involving reciprocals known as a harmonic series.\nHarmonic Mean Formula. The harmonic mean of a set of observations \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) is:\n\\[\n\\bar{X}_H = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1/X_i)}\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\nwith \\(X_i &gt; 0\\) for \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\).\nThe harmonic mean is the value obtained by summing the reciprocals of the observations,\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1/X_i),\n\\]\nthe terms of the form \\(1/X_i\\), and then averaging their sum by dividing it by the number of observations, \\(n\\), and then finally, taking the reciprocal of that average,\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1/X_i)}.\n\\]\nThe harmonic mean may be viewed as a special type of weighted mean in which an observation’s weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude. For example, if there is a sample of observations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1,000, the harmonic mean is 2.8560. Compared to the arithmetic mean of 145.8571, we see the influence of the outlier (the 1,000) to be much less than in the case of the arithmetic mean. So, the harmonic mean is quite useful as a measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.\nThe harmonic mean is used most often when the data consist of rates and ratios, such as P/Es. Suppose three peer companies have P/Es of 45, 15, and 15. The arithmetic mean is 25, but the harmonic mean, which gives less weight to the P/E of 45, is 19.3.\nThe harmonic mean is a relatively specialized concept of the mean that is appropriate for averaging ratios (“amount per unit”) when the ratios are repeatedly applied to a fixed quantity to yield a variable number of units. The concept is best explained through an illustration. A well-known application arises in the investment strategy known as cost averaging, which involves the periodic investment of a fixed amount of money. In this application, the ratios we are averaging are prices per share at different purchase dates, and we are applying those prices to a constant amount of money to yield a variable number of shares. An illustration of the harmonic mean to cost averaging is provided in Example 6.\nExample 6 here\nBecause they use the same data but involve different progressions in their respective calculations, the arithmetic,geometric, and harmonic means are mathematically related to one another. We will not go into the proof of this relationship, but the basic result follows:\nArithmetic mean × Harmonic mean = (Geometric mean)\\(^2\\).\nUnless all the observations in a dataset are the same value, the harmonic mean is always less than the geometric mean, which, in turn, is always less than the arithmetic mean.\nThe harmonic mean only works for non-negative numbers, so when working with returns that are expressed as positive or negative percentages, we first convert the returns into a compounding format, assuming a reinvestment, as \\((1 + R)\\), as was done in the geometric mean return calculation, and then calculate \\((1 +\\) harmonic mean\\()\\), and subtract 1 to arrive at the harmonic mean return.\n\n\n\n4 MONEY-WEIGHTED AND TIME-WEIGHTED RETURN\n\nThe internal rate of return is the discount rate at which the sum of present values of cash flows will equal zero. In general, the equation may be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{CF_t}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^t} = 0\n\\tag{5}\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of periods, \\(CF_t\\) is the cash flow at time \\(t\\), and IRR is the internal rate of return or the money-weighted rate of return.\nA cash flow can be positive or negative; a positive cash flow is an inflow where money flows to the investor, whereas a negative cash flow is an outflow where money flows away from the investor. The cash flows are expressed as follows, where each cash inflow or outflow occurs at the end of each year. Thus, \\(CF_0\\) refers to the cash flow at the end of Year 0 or beginning of Year 1, and \\(CF_3\\) refers to the cash flow at end of Year 3 or beginning of Year 4. Because cash flows are being discounted to the present, that is, end of Year 0 or beginning of Year 1, the period of discounting \\(CF_0\\) is zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCF_0 &= -100 \\\\\nCF_1 &= -950 \\\\\nCF_2 &= +350 \\\\\nCF_3 &= +1{,}270\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{CF_0}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^0}\n+ \\frac{CF_1}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^1}\n+ \\frac{CF_2}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^2}\n+ \\frac{CF_3}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{-100}{1}\n+ \\frac{-950}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^1}\n+ \\frac{+350}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^2}\n+ \\frac{+1270}{(1 + \\text{IRR})^3}\n= 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{IRR} = 26.11\\%\n\\]\nThe investor’s internal rate of return, or the money-weighted rate of return, is 26.11 percent, which tells the investor what she earned on the actual euros invested for the entire period on an annualized basis. This return is much greater than the arithmetic and geometric mean returns because only a small amount was invested when the mutual fund’s return was −50 percent.\nAll the above calculations can be performed using Excel using the =IRR(values) function, which results in an IRR of 26.11 percent.\n\nTime-Weighted Returns\nAn investment measure that is not sensitive to the additions and withdrawals of funds is the time-weighted rate of return. The time-weighted rate of return measures the compound rate of growth of USD1 initially invested in the portfolio over a stated measurement period. For the evaluation of portfolios of publicly traded securities, the time-weighted rate of return is the preferred performance measure as it neutralizes the effect of cash withdrawals or additions to the portfolio, which are generally outside of the control of the portfolio manager.\nComputing Time-Weighted Returns\nTo compute an exact time-weighted rate of return on a portfolio, take the following three steps:\n\nPrice the portfolio immediately prior to any significant addition or withdrawal of funds. Break the overall evaluation period into subperiods based on the dates of cash inflows and outflows.\nCalculate the holding period return on the portfolio for each subperiod.\nLink or compound holding period returns to obtain an annual rate of return for the year (the time-weighted rate of return for the year). If the investment is for more than one year, take the geometric mean of the annual returns to obtain the time-weighted rate of return over that measurement period.\n\nLet us return to our dividend stock money-weighted example in the section, “Money-Weighted Return for a Dividend-Paying Stock” and calculate the time-weighted rate of return for that investor’s portfolio based on the information included in Exhibit 11. In that example, we computed the holding period returns on the portfolio, Step 2 in the procedure for finding the time-weighted rate of return. Given that the portfolio earned returns of 15 percent during the first year and 6.67 percent during the second year, what is the portfolio’s time-weighted rate of return over an evaluation period of two years?\nWe find this time-weighted return by taking the geometric mean of the two holding period returns, Step 3 in the previous procedure. The calculation of the geometric mean exactly mirrors the calculation of a compound growth rate. Here, we take the product of 1 plus the holding period return for each period to find the terminal value at \\(t = 2\\) of USD1 invested at \\(t = 0\\). We then take the square root of this product and subtract 1 to get the geometric mean return. We interpret the result as the annual compound growth rate of USD1 invested in the portfolio at \\(t = 0\\). Thus, we have:\n\\[\n(1 + \\text{Time-weighted return})^2 = (1.15)(1.0667)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Time-weighted return} = \\sqrt{(1.15)(1.0667)} - 1 = 10.76\\%\n\\]\nThe time-weighted return on the portfolio was 10.76 percent, compared with the money-weighted return of 9.39 percent, which gave larger weight to the second year’s return. We can see why investment managers find time-weighted returns more meaningful. If a client gives an investment manager more funds to invest at an unfavorable time, the manager’s money-weighted rate of return will tend to be depressed. If a client adds funds at a favorable time, the money-weighted return will tend to be elevated. The time-weighted rate of return removes these effects.\nIn defining the steps to calculate an exact time-weighted rate of return, we said that the portfolio should be valued immediately prior to any significant addition or withdrawal of funds. With the amount of cash flow activity in many portfolios, this task can be costly. We can often obtain a reasonable approximation of the time-weighted rate of return by valuing the portfolio at frequent, regular intervals, particularly if additions and withdrawals are unrelated to market movements.\nThe more frequent the valuation, the more accurate the approximation. Daily valuation is commonplace. Suppose that a portfolio is valued daily over the course of a year. To compute the time-weighted return for the year, we first compute each day’s holding period return. We compute 365 such daily returns, denoted \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), …, \\(R_{365}\\). We obtain the annual return for the year by linking the daily holding period returns in the following way: \\((1 + R_1) \\times (1 + R_2) \\times \\cdots \\times (1 + R_{365}) - 1\\). If withdrawals and additions to the portfolio happen only at day’s end, this annual return is a precise time-weighted rate of return for the year. Otherwise, it is an approximate time-weighted return for the year.\nIf we have several years of data, we can calculate a time-weighted return for each year individually, as above. If \\(R_i\\) is the time-weighted return for year \\(i\\), we calculate an annualized time-weighted return as the geometric mean of \\(N\\) annual returns, as follows:\n\\[\nR_{TW} = \\left[(1 + R_1) \\times (1 + R_2) \\times \\cdots \\times (1 + R_N)\\right]^{1/N} - 1.\n\\tag{6}\n\\]\nExample 9 illustrates the calculation of the time-weighted rate of return.\n\nAnnualized Return\nThe period during which a return is earned or computed can vary. Often, we need to annualize a return that was calculated for a period shorter or longer than one year. For example, you might buy a short-term Treasury bill with a maturity of three months, or take a position in a futures contract that expires at the end of the next quarter. How can these returns be compared?\nIn many cases, it is most convenient to annualize all available returns to facilitate comparison. Daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly returns are therefore converted to annualized returns. Many formulas used for calculating certain values or prices also require all returns and periods to be expressed as annualized rates of return. For example, the most common version of the Black–Scholes option-pricing model requires returns to be annualized and time to be expressed in years.\n\n\n\n5 ANNUALIZED RETURN\n\nNon-annual Compounding\nRecall that interest may be paid semiannually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. To handle interest payments made more than once a year, we can modify the present value formula as follows. Here, \\(R_s\\) is the quoted interest rate and equals the periodic interest rate multiplied by the number of compounding periods in each year. In general, with more than one compounding period in a year, we can express the formula for present value as follows:\n\\[\nPV = FV_N \\left(1 + \\frac{R_s}{m}\\right)^{-mN},\n\\tag{7}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\(m\\) = number of compounding periods per year,\n\\(R_s\\) = quoted annual interest rate, and\n\\(N\\) = number of years.\nThe formula in Equation 7 is quite similar to the simple present value formula. As we have already noted, present value and future value factors are reciprocals. Changing the frequency of compounding does not alter this result. The only difference is the use of the periodic interest rate and the corresponding number of compounding periods.\nExample 11 presents an application of monthly compounding.\n\nAnnualizing Returns\nTo annualize any return for a period shorter than one year, the return for the period must be compounded by the number of periods in a year. A monthly return is compounded 12 times, a weekly return is compounded 52 times, and a quarterly return is compounded 4 times. Daily returns are normally compounded 365 times. For an uncommon number of days, we compound by the ratio of 365 to the number of days.\nIf the weekly return is 0.2 percent, then the compound annual return is 10.95 percent (there are 52 weeks in a year):\n\\[\nR_{annual} = (1 + R_{weekly})^{52} - 1 = (1 + 0.2\\%)^{52} - 1.\n\\]\n\\[\n= (1.002)^{52} - 1 = 0.1095 = 10.95\\%.\n\\]\nIf the return for 15 days is 0.4 percent, then the annualized return is 10.20 percent, assuming 365 days in a year:\n\\[\nR_{annual} = (1 + R_{15})^{365/15} - 1 = (1 + 0.4\\%)^{365/15} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= (1.004)^{365/15} - 1 = 0.1020 = 10.20\\%.\n\\]\nA general equation to annualize returns is given, where \\(c\\) is the number of periods in a year. For a quarter, \\(c = 4\\) and for a month, \\(c = 12\\):\n\\[\nR_{annual} = (1 + R_{period})^{c} - 1.\n\\tag{8}\n\\]\nHow can we annualize a return when the holding period return is more than one year? For example, how do we annualize an 18-month holding period return? Because one year contains two-thirds of 18-month periods, \\(c = 2/3\\) in the above equation. For example, an 18-month return of 20 percent can be annualized as follows:\n\\[\nR_{annual} = (1 + R_{18month})^{2/3} - 1 = (1 + 0.20)^{2/3} - 1 = 0.1292 = 12.92\\%.\n\\]\nSimilar expressions can be constructed when quarterly or weekly returns are needed for comparison instead of annual returns. In such cases, \\(c\\) is equal to the number of holding periods in a quarter or in a week. For example, assume that you want to convert daily returns to weekly returns or annual returns to weekly returns for comparison between weekly returns. To convert daily returns to weekly returns, \\(c = 5\\), assume that there are five trading days in a week. However, daily return calculations can be annualized differently. For example, five can be used for trading-day-based calculations, giving approximately 250 trading days a year; seven can be used on calendar-day-based calculations. Specific methods used conform to specific business practices, market conventions, and standards. To convert annual returns to weekly returns, \\(c = 1/52\\). The expressions for annual returns can then be rewritten as expressions for weekly returns as follows:\n\\[\nR_{weekly} = (1 + R_{daily})^{5} - 1; \\quad\nR_{weekly} = (1 + R_{annual})^{1/52} - 1.\n\\tag{9}\n\\]\nOne major limitation of annualizing returns is the implicit assumption that returns can be repeated precisely, that is, money can be reinvested repeatedly while earning a similar return. This type of return is not always possible. An investor may earn a return of 5 percent during a week because the market rose sharply that week, but it is highly unlikely that he will earn a return of 5 percent every week for the next 51 weeks, resulting in an annualized return of 1,164.3 percent \\((1.05^{52} - 1)\\). Therefore, it is important to annualize short-term returns with this limitation in mind.\n\nContinuously Compounded Returns\nAn important concept is the continuously compounded return associated with a holding period return, such as \\(R_1\\). The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period return is the natural logarithm of one plus that holding period return, or equivalently, the natural logarithm of the ending price over the beginning price (the price relative). Note that here we are using \\(r\\) to refer specifically to continuously compounded returns, but other textbooks and sources may use a different notation.\nIf we observe a one-week holding period return of 0.04, the equivalent continuously compounded return, called the one-week continuously compounded return, is \\(\\ln(1.04) = 0.039221\\); EUR1.00 invested for one week at 0.039221 continuously compounded gives EUR1.04, equivalent to a 4 percent one-week holding period return.\nThe continuously compounded return from \\(t\\) to \\(t + 1\\) is\n\\[\nr_{t,t+1} = \\ln(P_{t+1}/P_t) = \\ln(1 + R_{t,t+1}).\n\\tag{10}\n\\]\nFor our example, an asset purchased at time \\(t\\) for \\(P_0\\) of USD30 and the same asset one period later, \\(t + 1\\), has a value of \\(P_1\\) of USD34.50 has a continuously compounded return given by \\(r_{0,1} = \\ln(P_1/P_0) = \\ln(1 + R_{0,1}) = \\ln(\\text{USD34.50/USD30}) = \\ln(1.15) = 0.139762\\). Thus, 13.98 percent is the continuously compounded return from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 1\\).\nThe continuously compounded return is smaller than the associated holding period return. If our investment horizon extends from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = T\\), then the continuously compounded return to \\(T\\) is\n\\[\nr_{0,T} = \\ln(P_T/P_0).\n\\tag{11}\n\\]\nApplying the exponential function to both sides of the equation, we have \\(\\exp(r_{0,T}) = \\exp[\\ln(P_T/P_0)] = P_T/P_0\\), so\n\\[\nP_T = P_0 \\exp(r_{0,T}).\n\\]\nWe can also express \\(P_T/P_0\\) as the product of price relatives:\n\\[\nP_T/P_0 = (P_T/P_{T-1})(P_{T-1}/P_{T-2}) \\ldots (P_1/P_0).\n\\tag{12}\n\\]\nTaking logs of both sides of this equation, we find that the continuously compounded return to time \\(T\\) is the sum of the one-period continuously compounded returns:\n\\[\nr_{0,T} = r_{T-1,T} + r_{T-2,T-1} + \\ldots + r_{0,1}.\n\\tag{13}\n\\]\nUsing holding period returns to find the ending value of a USD1 investment involves the multiplication of quantities \\((1 + \\text{holding period return})\\). Using continuously compounded returns involves addition (as shown in Equation 13), which is a desirable property of continuously compounded returns and which we will use throughout the curriculum.\n\n\n\n6 OTHER MAJOR RETURN MEASURES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\n\nReal Returns\nPreviously this learning module approximated the relationship between the nominal rate and the real rate by the following relationship:\n\\[\n(1 + \\text{nominal risk-free rate}) = (1 + \\text{real risk-free rate})(1 + \\text{inflation premium}).\n\\]\nThis relationship can be extended to link the relationship between nominal and real returns. Specifically, the nominal return consists of a real risk-free rate of return to compensate for postponed consumption; inflation as loss of purchasing power; and a risk premium for assuming risk. Frequently, the real risk-free return and the risk premium are combined to arrive at the real “risky” rate and is simply referred to as the real return, or:\n\\[\n(1 + \\text{real return}) = (1 + \\text{real risk-free rate})(1 + \\text{risk premium}).\n\\tag{14}\n\\]\nReal returns are particularly useful in comparing returns across time periods because inflation rates may vary over time. Real returns are also useful in comparing returns among countries when returns are expressed in local currencies instead of a constant investor currency and when inflation rates vary between countries (which are usually the case).\nFinally, the after-tax real return is what the investor receives as compensation for postponing consumption and assuming risk after paying taxes on investment returns. As a result, the after-tax real return becomes a reliable benchmark for making investment decisions. Although it is a measure of an investor’s benchmark return, it is not commonly calculated by asset managers because it is difficult to estimate a general tax component applicable to all investors. For example, the tax component depends on an investor’s specific taxation rate (marginal tax rate), how long the investor holds an investment (long-term versus short-term), and the type of account the asset is held in (tax-exempt, tax-deferred, or normal).\n\nLeveraged Return\nIn the previous calculations, we have assumed that the investor’s position in an asset is equal to the total investment made by an investor using his or her own money. This section differs in that the investor creates a leveraged position.\nThere are two ways of creating a claim on asset returns that are greater than the investment of one’s own money. First, an investor may trade futures contracts in which the money required to take a position may be as little as 10 percent of the notional value of the asset. In this case, the leveraged return, the return on the investor’s own money, is 10 times the actual return of the underlying security. Both the gains and losses are amplified by a factor of 10.\nInvestors can also invest more than their own money by borrowing money to purchase the asset. This approach is easily done in stocks and bonds, and very common when investing in real estate. If half (50 percent) of the money invested is borrowed, then the gross return to the investor is doubled, but the interest to be paid on borrowed money must be deducted to calculate the net return.\nUsing borrowed capital, debt, the size of the leveraged position increases by the additional, borrowed capital. If the total investment return earned on the leveraged portfolio, \\(R_p\\), exceeds the borrowing cost on debt, \\(r_D\\), taking on leverage increases the return on the portfolio. Denoting the return on a leveraged portfolio as \\(R_L\\), then the return can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\nR_L\n= \\frac{\\text{Portfolio return}}{\\text{Portfolio equity}}\n= \\frac{[R_p \\times (V_E + V_B) - (V_B \\times r_D)]}{V_E}\n= R_p + \\frac{V_B}{V_E}(R_p - r_D),\n\\tag{15}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V_E\\) is the equity of the portfolio and \\(V_B\\) is the debt or borrowed funds. If \\(R_p &lt; r_D\\), then leverage decreases \\(R_L\\).\nFor example, for a EUR10 million equity portfolio that generates an 8 percent total investment return, \\(R_p\\), over one year and is financed 30 percent with debt at 5 percent, then the leveraged return, \\(R_L\\), is:\n\\[\nR_L\n= R_p + \\frac{V_B}{V_E}(R_p - r_D)\n= 8\\% + \\frac{\\text{EUR3 million}}{\\text{EUR7 million}}(8\\% - 5\\%)\n= 8\\% + 0.43 \\times 3\\%\n= 9.29\\%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
